AutoCompleteAccounts
====================

This is a Fat Free CRM Plugin, see: http://github.com/michaeldv/fat_free_crm

Plugin to replace the selection box for accounts with an auto-complete 
text field. Having a selection box for accounts becomes a pain when you
have lost of accounts.

The plugin replaces the retrieval of all accounts for the Contacts and
Opportunities Controllers. For create, edit and new actions. In addition,
the _top_section partial is modified to use a text_field_with_auto_complete.

Prerequiste
===========

You'll need to install the auto_complete plugin:

  script/plugin install git://github.com/rails/auto_complete.git

Usage
=====

To install this plugin:

  script/plugin install git://github.com/gorenje/crm_auto_complete_accounts.git

After that the accounts input field will be auto completed.

Bugs
====

No tests. Sorry, this a quick hack that needs to be done better:
 - need to be able to use hooks to insert the text_field_with_auto_complete
 - duplication of the controller methods is a pain, better would be to 
   have a hook for Account retrieval (or something else).

Compatibility
=============

There is also no guarantee that this plugin will keep working with 
newer versions of Fat Free CRM. It works with Release 0.10.1 (1. Sept 2010).
